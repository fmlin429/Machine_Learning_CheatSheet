Start Jupyter: 

#### Batch Epocod Concepts and Examples:
Sample dataset size = 200
Batch size = 5 (The model weights will be updated after each batch of five samples)
Batch Number = 200/5 = 40 

epochs = 1000
Every epoch will run all 40 batches (40 updates to the model)

With 1,000 epochs, the model will be exposed to or pass through the whole dataset 1,000 times. That is a total of 40,000 batches during the entire training process.
